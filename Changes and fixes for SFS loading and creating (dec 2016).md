Already since the beginning of DebianDog there was support for loading SFS's modules (.squashfs extension)    
Later it became more and more extended with the addition to load modules 'on the fly' (load during a session) and also on a full install (using fuse in a chrooted environment).   
Now (dec 2016) after much more testing there are many fixes done.
The problem was mostly that deactivating (unloading) didn't work in some cases.
Therefore the scripts that can be used to create a module e.g. apt2sfs, remastercow needed modifying too.  

**New:**   
- Created SFS repository: [Extra Modules splitted in categories](https://github.com/DebianDog/SFSget/releases)   
All modules are without dpkg registration, e.g. not included /var/lib/dpkg/status file, this means it cannot break the dpkg database.   
- package: 'sfsget' for downloading from above repository, install:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install sfsget
```   
SfsGet is replacement for the script 'sfs-get' that's part of sfs-get-smokey-get package.



#### Fixes 2016-12-08 (see more details below):
Upgrade the following packages to latest version:
- sfsload v 1.0.2 or higher (changes: remove cache files just before loading to prevent problems when unloading)
- apt2sfs v 1.1.1 or higher (changes: remove cache files, they are automatically generated by any script that activates a module)
- remastercow (remasterscripts v 1.0.7 or higher) (changes same as for apt2sfs)
- portablesfs-loadsfs-fuse v 1.0.6 or higher (changes same as for loadsfs)

##### Details:
In case loading a .squashfs module 'on the fly' there were problems, i.e. when unloading (deactivating)
Sometime ago I _thought_ to have found the solution by using aubusy (from the aufs-tools package)...
...find the pid of the process (using aubusy) that prevents unloading (unmounting in fact) and kill it.   
When testing more with several modules it appeared wrong because some processes were killed unwanted, for example Thunar and xfce4-panel.   
More research lead me to a solution: remove all the cache files; e.g. mimeinfo.cache, mime.cache and icon-theme.cache files first when loading, the 'loadmodule' script will recreate them by using e.g. 'update-icon-caches' or 'update-desktop-database' commands.   
Then unloading a module works fine from what I tested.
